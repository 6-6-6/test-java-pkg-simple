## Intro
This is a Gentoo Overlay that publishs ebuild files of some java packges.
Most of those ebuild files are produced by 'app-portage/java-ebuilder',
but some ebuild files need a little adjustments (JAVA_TEST_EXCLUDES) to pass src_test phase.

To get a start, please follow the 'Quick Start' section.

Ebuild files that were generated by java-ebuilder are listed in the 'Packages' section.

## Quick Start
to add the overlay via `layman`
```
sudo layman -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/6-6-6/test-java-pkg-simple/master/resources/overlay.xml\
	-f -a test-java-pkg-simple
```
to install the latest app-portage/java-ebuilder from my repository
```
sudo emerge -av app-portage/java-ebuilder::test-java-pkg-simple
```
to install and test java packages
```
cd ${PATH_TO_THIS_OVERLAY}
find dev-java/ -type f -name \*.ebuild -exec sudo FEATURES="test" USE="doc source" emerge -1v {} \;
```
